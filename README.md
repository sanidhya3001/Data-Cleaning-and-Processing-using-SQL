# Data-Cleaning-using-SQL
Summary: SQL Project for Housing Data 

This project involves cleaning and preparing housing data using SQL to ensure the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. The data typically includes various attributes such as address, city, state, zip code, price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, lot size, year built, and date listed.

Steps Involved:

1. Data Import:
   - Create a table structure to hold the housing data.
   - Load the data into the table, ensuring it matches the predefined schema.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Removing Duplicates: Identify and remove any duplicate records to ensure each entry is unique.
   - Handling Missing Values: Identify columns with missing values and decide on strategies such as filling with default values, using statistical methods, or removing incomplete records.
   - Standardizing Data Formats: Ensure all data entries follow a consistent format, particularly for date, address, and numerical fields.

3. Data Validation:
   - Ensuring Data Consistency: Verify that the data adheres to logical constraints (e.g., bedrooms and bathrooms should be positive numbers).
   - Range Checks: Ensure numerical values fall within reasonable ranges to detect any outliers or data entry errors.

4. Data Transformation:
   - Creating New Features: Generate new attributes from existing data if necessary (e.g., price per square foot).
   - Normalization: Normalize data to a common scale if required for analysis to ensure comparability.

5. Quality Assurance:
   - Final Checks: Perform final checks to ensure data quality and readiness for analysis. This includes verifying that there are no missing or inconsistent values remaining.

Outcome

By following these steps, the housing data will be cleaned and standardized, ensuring it is accurate, consistent, and ready for further analysis or reporting. This process enhances the reliability of insights drawn from the data and supports better decision-making based on the cleaned dataset.
